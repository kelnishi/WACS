## WACS.Transpiler / WACS.Transpiler.Lib [0.2.0] Cross-process loading

- **Package split**: WACS.Transpiler remains the `wasm-transpile`
  dotnet-tool CLI; the programmatic surface (AOT namespace + Hosting
  helpers) now ships as a separate NuGet package **WACS.Transpiler.Lib**.
  Consumers who only want the library can reference it without pulling
  the tool packaging.
- **Saved .dlls now run in a fresh process.** Every transpiled assembly
  embeds a codec-encoded `ModuleInitData` as a `byte[]` field on a
  generated `__WACSInit` type. The Module constructor dispatches through
  `InitializationHelper.InitializeFromEmbedded`: in-process transpile +
  run keeps the fast `InitRegistry` path; cross-process load decodes the
  embedded bytes and rebuilds memories, tables, globals, data segments,
  and type metadata from the codec with no re-parse of the original
  WASM. Closes the v0.1 "cross-process execution is not yet supported"
  limitation.
- **Codec format documented and versioned.** Format spec in
  `Wacs.Core/Compilation/../../Wacs.Transpiler.Lib/AOT/InitDataFormat.md`:
  8-byte "WACSINIT" magic, u8 major+minor version, TLV-tagged section
  stream. Unknown tags skipped on decode (forward compat); newer-major
  files rejected cleanly. 60+ unit tests cover each section and
  primitive.
- **`TranspiledModuleLoader` (new)**: seamless dynamic-environment
  loading. Reads a saved `.dll`, discovers the Module / IExports /
  IImports types, wires imports (typed object OR by-name delegate
  dictionary via `DispatchProxy`), returns a `LoadedModule` handle
  that exposes the interfaces as first-class reflection objects plus
  `Invoke(name, args)` / `GetExport<TDelegate>(name)` for dispatch.
- **`Wacs.Console` integration**: new `--aot` flag transpiles the
  instantiated module and runs through the transpiled code. Subset of
  `TranspilerOptions` surfaced via `--aot_simd`, `--aot_no_tail_calls`,
  `--aot_max_fn_size`, `--aot_data_storage`; `--aot_save <path>` also
  persists the .dll to disk. CoreMark end-to-end: **17,542 iter/sec**
  on `--aot` vs 376 (`--switch --switch_super`) vs 277 (polymorphic).
- **Still not covered in 0.2** (tracked for v0.3): `--emit-main`
  expansion (auto-bind `--wasi-host`, `--allow-missing-imports` stubs,
  ref-type / v128 argv parsing).
- Spec parity unchanged: 473/473 on WebAssembly 3.0 spec suite; the new
  codec + loader add 70 unit tests + 4 cross-process end-to-end tests
  (549 total transpiler suite).

## [0.8.1] Switch runtime (opt-in, source-generated dispatcher)

- New alternative interpreter backed by a source-generated monolithic
  `switch` over an annotated bytecode stream. Immediates are pre-decoded
  at instantiation (no LEB128 at runtime), branch targets resolved to
  absolute stream offsets, and every reachable function is compiled
  eagerly when `UseSwitchRuntime` is set before `InstantiateModule`.
  AOT-safe — no `Reflection.Emit`, no `DynamicMethod`; build-time source
  generation only.
- Opt-in at the API level:
  ```csharp
  runtime.UseSwitchRuntime = true;
  runtime.ExecContext.Attributes.UseSwitchSuperInstructions = true; // optional stream-fuser
  runtime.InstantiateModule(module);
  ```
- `Wacs.Console` exposes the runtime through two new flags: `--switch`
  routes dispatch through the switch runtime; `--switch_super`
  additionally enables the bytecode-stream super-instruction fuser.
- **Spec parity: 118/118 wast files pass** on the WebAssembly 3.0 spec
  suite (matching the polymorphic runtime).
- Rough microbenchmarks (M1 Pro, .NET 8, median of 3): `switch` +
  `swFuse` is 1.5–2× faster than polymorphic across `fib-iter` / `fac` /
  `sum`. CoreMark: 376 iter/s (`--switch --switch_super`) vs 277 iter/s
  polymorphic — a 36% improvement on a real workload.
- Full architecture walkthrough in
  [`Wacs.Core/Compilation/SWITCH_RUNTIME.md`](Wacs.Core/Compilation/SWITCH_RUNTIME.md)
  (phases A–N, including the iterative Run that eliminates native-stack
  growth per WASM call).
- The polymorphic runtime remains the default and is unaffected.

## WACS.Transpiler [0.1.0] First release

- New NuGet package: `WACS.Transpiler`. Installs as a dotnet global tool
  (command: `wasm-transpile`). Ahead-of-time transpiles a `.wasm` module
  into a .NET assembly.
- CLI surface mirrors `TranspilerOptions`: `--simd`, `--no-tail-calls`,
  `--max-fn-size`, `--data-storage`, `--gc-checking`.
- `--emit-main` / `--entry-point` / `--main-class` bundle a host
  `Program.Main` into the output assembly for modules with no imports
  and scalar exports.
- `--run` invokes the emitted `Program.Main` in-process after
  transpiling, forwarding any trailing positional args — handy for IDE
  run configurations that want to transpile-and-execute in one step.
- Library surface: `Wacs.Transpiler.AOT.ModuleTranspiler.Transpile(...)`
  and `TranspilationResult.SaveAssembly(path)` for programmatic use.
- **Spec-equivalent to the WACS interpreter: 473/473 passing on the
  WebAssembly 3.0 spec test suite**, verified on both macOS ARM64 and
  Linux x64. Includes: multi-result `return` / `call_indirect` dispatch
  (via a MethodInfo registry for targets whose byref out-params don't
  fit Func/Action delegates), `f32.convert_i64_u` / `f64.convert_i64_u`
  routed through the interpreter's spec-exact RTNE helper for
  platform-invariant rounding, `struct.new` / `struct.new_default`
  global initializers with typed field storage, and correct
  sign/zero-extension for packed i8 / i16 struct reads.
- Known limitation: the saved `.dll` is intended for in-process use in
  this release — cross-process standalone execution (init-data embedded
  into the assembly) is a v0.2 milestone. See
  `Wacs.Transpiler/README.md` for details.

## [0.8.0] Public transpiler surface

- Public getters on ~20 instruction classes, `IFunctionInstance.Invoke`
  on the interface, `Store.ReplaceFunction`, and runtime accessors so
  `WACS.Transpiler` can drive transpilation from outside the assembly.
- New `WasmRuntime.TryGetExported{Memory,Table,Global,Tag}` /
  `GetExported{Memory,Table,Global,Tag}` accessors, mirroring the
  existing `TryGetExportedFunction` shape so host code can resolve any
  exported entity without reflecting into internals. Resolves #63.
- **Rename (breaking):** The interpreter super-instruction flag
  `WasmRuntime.TranspileModules` → `WasmRuntime.SuperInstruction`, the
  method `TranspileModule` → `ApplySuperInstructions`, and the
  `Wacs.Core.Runtime.Transpiler` / `Wacs.Core.Instructions.Transpiler`
  namespaces → `...SuperInstruction`. `FunctionTranspiler.TranspileFunction`
  is now `SuperInstructionRewriter.Rewrite`. This disambiguates from the
  new `WACS.Transpiler` AOT package.
- No behavior change for existing consumers beyond the rename — additive otherwise.
